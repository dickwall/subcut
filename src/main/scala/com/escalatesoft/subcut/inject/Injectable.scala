 * the bindings to be used. There are several ways to provide these binding modules: simple val override
 * in the class, mixing in a trait that defines the bindingModule (see BoundToModule), a constructor parameter
 * or, perhaps most flexibly, an implicit constructor parameter in a curried parameter list. This last option
 * can provide flexible and mostly invisible bindings all the way down an object instance creation chain.
